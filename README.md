# AI-MachineLearning

This repository contains a variety of machine learning projects as part of the Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford University. Each project focuses on a different area of machine learning, showcasing advanced algorithms, unsupervised learning techniques, and reinforcement learning.

## 1. Advanced Algorithms

- **Decision_Tree_Classification**: Implementing a decision tree classifier to understand decision boundaries and feature importance in classification tasks.

- **ML_Model_Evaluation_Improvement**: Techniques for evaluating and improving machine learning model performance, including cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

- **NN_HandWritten_Digits_Recognition_Binary**: A binary classification neural network designed to recognize handwritten digits using a simplified dataset.

- **NN_HandWritten_Digits_Recognition_Multiclass**: Extending binary classification to multiclass prediction to recognize handwritten digits from a full dataset.

## 2. Unsupervised Learning and Recommenders

- **Anomaly_Detection_Servers**: Detecting anomalous behavior in server operations using unsupervised learning algorithms.

- **Collaborative_RecSys_Movies**: Building a collaborative filtering recommendation system for movies, learning user preferences based on ratings.

- **DeepLearning_ContentBased_Filtering_Movies**: Developing a content-based filtering system using deep learning to recommend movies based on their characteristics.

- **DeepQLearning_LunarLander**: Applying Deep Q-Learning to train an agent to autonomously land on the lunar surface in a the [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) environment.

- **Image_Compression_KMeans**: Utilizing the K-Means clustering algorithm to compress images by reducing the color space.

- **PCA_Visualization_Examples**: Demonstrating the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.
